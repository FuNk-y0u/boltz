# Boltz [âš¡]
  
Boltz is a Python-based API simplifying Spotify playlist, album, and track conversion to MP3, allowing users to save music to their preferred location. Developers leverage Boltz to efficiently retrieve Spotify content by providing identifiers, utilizing Spotify's infrastructure for data fetching and MP3 conversion. Users specify the destination directory for flexibility in managing their library. Boltz streamlines Spotify access, empowering developers to innovate with music applications like players, backups, and playlist converters in Python projects.

CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('CLIENT_SECRET')

# * Initializing boltz controller
_boltzController = Boltz(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, "[download path]")

# * Passing in pl link
url = _boltzController.initialize_url("[playlist url]")
ASSERT(url.is_valid, "Error: Spotify url is not valid")

tracks = _boltzController.fetch_tracks(url)
ASSERT(tracks, "Error: while fetching tracks")

# * Looping through all the tracks in playlist/album/track
for track in tracks:
    print(f"Dowloading: {track.name} ...")

    # * Downloading track
